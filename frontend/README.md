### Before we get started:

You'll need MetaMask installed to get this working. If you don't already have it, start by downloading & installing the MetaMask extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge: https://metamask.io/download.html (be careful to triple check the URL and ensure you are downloading from a trusted website). If you haven't set up MetaMask before, follow the instructions to set up an Ethereum account.

## Run the App
```
npm install 
npm start 
```
